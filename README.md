#MK2i Heated Build Platform
This repository contains the PCB design files for the MK2i PCB Heated Build Platform for 3D Printers.

##Features
The MK2i heated is a hybrid of the open-source MK2a and MK3 PCB heated.  Revisions and features in this variant include:
----
* Large pads for soldering power wires.
* Pads for SMD or through-hole thermistor on top and bottom.  PCB trace on top layer for wiring soldered thermistor.  Still has thermistor center-hole.  Use with many types of thermistor and no more taping thermistor to PCB!
* 4-point and 3-point mounting for PCB to platform.
* 1206 pads for LEDs and SMD resistor; also support through-hole components.
* Open source design based on proven MK2a and MK3 designs.
* Cleaned up outer trace in MK2a design.
* Designed for 1.0-1.2 ohm resistance.

Creating Gerber Files
-----
This repo contains the CAD file for the MK2i PCB heated.  You will need to generate a Gerber.  You will need the library to use this PCB design file and to generate GERBER output.
